# Web-API Example app

Web-API is a Node app to show how an API is being build.

## Requirements

Install NVM library to handle the node versions : 

https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

## Installation


```bash
nvm install v17.6.0
nvm use
npm install 

```


## Usage

```node
node api.js 
```

## Dockerized app 

Docker needs to be installed in order to set this up.

The first time this needs to be executed :

```bash
docker build -t nodejs-image-demo .
docker run --name nodejs-image-demo -p 80:3000 -d nodejs-image-demo


```

The next time that this needs to be executed :
```bash
docker start nodejs-image-demo

```
if the docker image needs to be stopped:

```bash
docker start nodejs-image-demo

```

The app will be running under port 80, this is intendeed to explain how docker works and how the mapping of ports are being handled.
